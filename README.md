# obj-editor-unity
a text based 3D model editor following basic syntax of the .obj format

simple-obj-editor provides an interface to edit your 3d model / unity mesh / .obj file text data and see the changes live.

# build link: https://hmnt.itch.io/obj-editor

# a brief how-to:
1. lines starting with v and followed by three numbers seperated by whitespace are vertices

2. lines starting with vn and followed by three numbers seperated by whitespace are vertex normals which decide the how light calculation works.

3. lines starting with f and followed by three values in the format of

f    v/vt/vn     v/vt/vn      v/vt/vn

are faces with v being vertex, vn being vertex normals and vt being vertex textures
(vertex textures, beziers and other freeform geometry .obj features are not used in this app for simplicity purposes).
we define three vertices in one face line as this doesn't directly support triangulation
